## Red Flags

### [P0] Security-Deep: 3 MEDIUM security patterns in recent files (review recommended)
**Impact:** Prompt injection, data exfiltration, or hidden malicious content detected
```
knowledge/trading/fwd-markets-am-the-dollar-is-losing-buoyancy-2026-01-28.md: Zero-Width Characters
knowledge/trading-books/-short-term-trading-strategies-that-work.md: Zero-Width Characters
knowledge/cmt-dow-award/2016-gayed-bilello.txt: Zero-Width Characters
```

### [P2] Frontmatter: 1 files with incomplete frontmatter
**Impact:** Files may not surface in KB searches
```
trade-ideas/category-43-test-drive---open-house.md: missing summary
```

### [P2] Structure: 14 non-standard top-level directories in knowledge/
**Impact:** Non-standard dirs may confuse search and categorization
```
knowledge/backtesting/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/backtests/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/cmt-dow-award/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/crypto/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/entities/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/expenses/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/gdrive-imports/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/infrastructure/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/life-coaching/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/orb-setups/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/strategy-rules/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/tradervue/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/trading-books/ — should this be under research/?
knowledge/trading-research/ — should this be under research/?
```

### [P2] Tag Quality: 85 files have fewer than 5 tags (weak searchability); 58 tag naming violations (should be kebab-case); 2216/4028 tags are used by only 1 file (55% orphan rate — poor cross-referencing)
**Impact:** Poor tags degrade Edge's ability to find relevant KB files
```
Low-tag files:
  crypto/INDEX.md: only 3 tags
  mabekit/lyop/lyop-24-hour-trading-is-coming.md: only 4 tags
  mabekit/lyop/lyop-choosing-a-backtesting-software.md: only 4 tags
  mabekit/lyop/lyop-dont-trade-alone.md: only 4 tags
  mabekit/lyop/lyop-no-time-to-trade-good.md: only 4 tags
  mabekit/lyop/lyop-why-dave-left-trade-ideas.md: only 4 tags
  mabekit/lyop/lyop-you-missed-a-trade---now-what.md: only 4 tags
  smb-playbooks/3-cheat-sheet-trades-examples-jureg.md: only 4 tags
  smb-playbooks/9-ema.md: only 4 tags
  smb-playbooks/back-ide-cheat-sheet.md: only 4 tags
  ... and 75 more
Inconsistent tags: ORB, Stoicism, Ryan Holiday, personal development, worry management, stress relief, mental health, Dale Carnegie, present moment, emotional control, practical psychology, social skills, emotional intelligence, Johann Hari, social connection ... +26 more
Tag stats: 4028 unique tags, 2216 orphan tags (single-use)
```

### [P2] Memory Quality: 3 daily logs over 500 lines (never distilled); CORE_MEMORY.md hasn't been updated in 13 days (stale); 21 daily logs older than 14 days without curation (should be distilled into topic files)
**Impact:** Uncurated memory means Edge loses learnings and loads stale context
```
Bloated logs:
  2026-02-10.md: 646 lines
  2026-02-16.md: 1030 lines
  2026-02-23.md: 611 lines
Memory stats: 37 daily logs (7797 total lines), 21 uncurated (>14d)
```

### [P3] Scripts: 1 scripts have multiple versions (consider archiving old ones)
**Impact:** Version sprawl creates confusion about which script is current
```
import-tradervue: import-tradervue, import-tradervue
```

### [P3] Naming: 5 files with naming convention violations
**Impact:** May break on Linux or cause path issues
```
expenses/2025 amex.md: spaces in filename
expenses/amex 02.22.26.md: spaces in filename
expenses/chase 02.22.26.md: spaces in filename
expenses/chase 2025.md: spaces in filename
expenses/paypal 2025.md: spaces in filename
```

## Action Items

**Oops handles (automated):**
- Fix 1 files with missing/incomplete frontmatter
- Flag low-quality tags for repair on next kb-update run

**Edge should:**
- Review flagged security patterns: 3 MEDIUM security patterns in recent files (review recommended)
- Review tag quality — files with <5 tags need better tagging for searchability
- Distill bloated daily logs into topic files and update CORE_MEMORY.md

**Alex decides:**
- 14 non-standard KB directories — reorganize or whitelist?
- Script version sprawl detected — archive old versions?
- 5 files with naming violations (spaces in filenames) — rename?

## Recurring Issues

- Grade has been unstable (C -> F -> B -> B -> C -> C -> C) — issues are being fixed but keep recurring
- Averaging 4.1 warnings/day over the last week — chronic issues not being resolved
- KB grew +159 files in 7 days (23/day) — is Edge auto-generating too much content?

## ✅ OK Passed Checks

- **Index:** TOPICS-INDEX.json is current (2095 files, generated 2026-02-24T21:16:11.015Z)
- **Security:** No secrets detected in committed files
- **Memory:** Memory directory: 3.6 MB, 1104 files, 37 daily logs
- **Orphans:** All KB files are indexed in TOPICS-INDEX.json
- **Git:** Working tree clean, all changes committed
- **Search Coverage:** All 2095 indexed files are searchable (2095 via topics, 2095 via keywords)
